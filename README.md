## Animal Detection And Classification

This project was implemented as a part of the group project in the course : Machine Learning 

Just as the name of this project suggests, the aim of this project was to develop an algorithm for detecting the animals from an image or a given frame and if detected, then classify them into a specific class of animals and detect their position coordinates. The need of this project came up with the impending threat of extinction on various species of animals, bio-diversity presevation, keeping surveillance of animals, avoid illegal poaching, etc. With the development of driverless cars, the need of such real-time detection algorithms become paramount for safety purposes in many crowded places to avoid unwanted human-animal accidents. YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm has been employed to detect the presence of any/many animals.
